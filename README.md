# Prolog Programming Assignments

This repository contains solutions to two Prolog programming assignments.

## Questions

### Question 1: Family Riddle

A popular children's riddle is "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son." Use the rules of the family domain (Section 8.3.2 on page 301 in the Textbook) to find who that man is using a Prolog program.

### Question 2: River Crossing Problem

A man, a woman and two children had to go to the opposite bank of a river using a boat. The man and the woman weighed 80 kg each and the children weighed 30 kg each. Given that the boat can carry up to 100 kg and that everyone can drive a boat, write a Prolog program to find how all four can cross the river with the boat.

## How to Run

Each question's directory contains a README with the approach and solution, as well as a Prolog file (.pl) with the code. To run the Prolog programs:

1. Ensure you have SWI-Prolog installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the respective question's directory.
3. Run the Prolog file using the command: `swipl -s filename.pl`

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the README in each question's directory.
